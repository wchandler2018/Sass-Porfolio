                </h3>
                <h5>hmmmmm, let's see....</h5>
                <p>Well that's an easy one...basically I'm a colony of roughly 37.2 trillion human cells living in symbiosis
                    with an equal number of bacterial cells; the product of around 125,000 generations of biologically successful
                    human beings...and I am...oh wait that is way more complicated than it should be,let me try again...<br><br>                    I
                    was born & raised in Norfolk, Virginia but I've had the privilege of living all over the United States
                    as member of the United States Army however, I currently call Charlotte, NC my home. A few fun facts
                    about me, I love motorcycles, fitness and food (not in that order), my claim to fame is I know every
                    word to every single song in The Lion King. I have come to the realization that I am an awful cook. I
                    have never in my life knowingly eaten a mushroom and I am deathly afraid of bridges. I have cat an incredibly
                    cute cat named Max...who turned out to be a girl...oops. Lastly, my friends frequently describe me as
                    annoyingly optomistic. <br><br> See More Below...

                <h3>My future: My Passion for coding</h3>
                <p>When I left the military it was hard for me to find a passion for anything else. I originally had my heart
                    set on going to Boston College Law School(that didn't go to well) but I quickly realize that law was
                    not passion. One day my neighbor, a web developer for a small marketing company showed what he does for
                    work and it was love and first site. I quickly began to read books, go to local programming meetups,
                    I watched 100s of hours YouTube videos & when I finally made my first website while not the prettiest
                    one ever but I couldn't wait to show my friends and family what I had done. Programming has made me excited
                    to learn again, I get up in the morning and can't decide what to work on, a React project, a Python project
                    or maybe a really cool website. I have finally the same passion that I had being a Soldier and I am so
                    excited and optomistic to see what the future will bring.<br><br>
